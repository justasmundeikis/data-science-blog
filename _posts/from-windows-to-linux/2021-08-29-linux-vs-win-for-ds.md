**What are the advantages and disadvantages of Linux compared to Windows10 for data science? Who should switch to Linux and who should stay at Windows10?**<!--more-->

Let me be frank with you, Linux is not as easy as I would like it to be. Though I believe, that today most of the users could and actually should use Linux, there are also some use cases, when Windows10 is a better choice. I will try to be as unbiased as possible in this blog post and list all Windows10 advantages, though I must admit, I don't see many.

# Advantages of Windows10

## 1. It is "easy"
The first and most important advantage of Windows10 in my view, is that most of us grew up with Windows. My first Windows was Windows98, which I got in with my first computer in 1999, soon after that I upgraded to Windows2000, then came WindowsXP, then Windows7. The latter war in my view the best OS I ever had. It was light, fast, and easy to use, so I dismissed Windows8, and only switched to Windows10, with the "free" upgrade possibility. I believe, that most of the readers, will have more or less the same experience - we get used to something and it feels native, and this feeling makes the use of Windows10 "easy".

I intentionally wrote "free" - as with Windows10, we, the users, became the product, owned by Microsoft, instead owning an operating system.

## 2. Widely used in corporate world with Microsoft ecosystem
The second most important advantage of Windows10 - it used almost everywhere in corporate world. Nowadays Microsoft advances into universities and even schools to promote their products and services. I hardly had any first year student not knowing what MS Excel or MS PowerPoint was. At universities, MS Word, PowerPoint are probably the most used IT tools ever. A dram to employers - being able to save lots of money: they do not have to invest in teaching their staff learn new OS, Word, Excel, PowerPoint programs. Sure, you might have grown up with Apple products (you have money and no brains...), so what does the quasi-monopolist Microsoft do? - offer MS Office for Apple OS :D

## 3. Some software works only on Windows10
You are too accustomed to Microsoft Office? To Adobe products? To gaming*? Well, then it will be hard to switch. LibreOffice or OpenOffice look somewhat different, they work bit differently and some very good features lack. E.g. the pivot functions in MS Excel are excellent, whereas in LibreOffice, oh well... I hope you don't need them. You are used to Adobe Photoshop - well it won't be available on Linux. So you must learn to use GIMP (which works really very well) which is a new program and takes time to do.

*Note: more and more games are being provided for Linux (e.g. via Steam)
